  <Question>
     How can I handle a constructor that fails ?
  </Question>

  <Answer>
     By throwing an exception. Constructors don't have a return type, so it's not possible to use
     return codes. The best way to signal constructor failure is therefore to throw an exception.

  <Question>
      What is difference between process and thread ?
  </Question>
  <Answer>
     The typical difference is that threads (of the same process) run in a shared memory space, 
     while processes run in separate memory spaces.
     Each thread has its own storage, stack, environment block, security context, set of registers
     exception handlers, priority. But all threads in one process share the same heap.

  <Question>
      What exactly is the role of Triage Engineer ?
  </Question>
  <Answer>
      This title is someone that classifies bugs for someone else to fix.
      When a bug report comes in, you mark it as duplicate if another one exists, ask for more 
      details if reproduce steps aren't clear, close it if it is not a bug, assign it to the main 
      engineer if it is a bug. Basically a issue tracker janitor.

  <Question>
      Difference between mutex and semorephone ?
  </Question>
  <Answer>
    - A mutex can be owned by only one thread at a time, enabling threads to coordinate mutually 
      exclusive access to a shared resource.

    - A semaphore maintains a count between zero and some maximum value, limiting the number of 
      threads that are simultaneously accessing a shared resource.

  <Question>
      What is Unique pointer and what is the diffrence between unique pointer and shared pointer?
  </Question>
  <Answer>
    - Unique pointer and Shared pointer are all smart pointers. Unique pointer means an object 
      can only be pointered by one pointer

    - shared pointers keeps a count on number of pointers to an object and when the count drops 
      to 0, the object is destroyed !

  <Question>
      What is weak pointer?
  </Question>
  <Answer>
      Weak pointer is a kind of pointer that does not own the object, does not affect the pointer count!
      in c++11, weak pointer example:

      std::weak_ptr&lt;Prism> parentAppPrism_;

      auto parentAppPrism = parentAppPrism_.lock();
      if (parentAppPrism == nullptr) {
        ML_LOG_ERROR("Must have non-null parent app prism");
        return;
      }

      Another example:
      #include &lt;iostream>
      #include &lt;memory>
 
     void observe(std::weak_ptr&lt;int> weak) 
     {
         if (auto observe = weak.lock()) {
             std::cout &lt;&lt; "\tobserve() able to lock weak_ptr&lt;>, value=" &lt;&lt; *observe &lt;&lt; "\n";
         } else {
             std::cout &lt;&lt; "\tobserve() unable to lock weak_ptr&lt;>\n";
         }
     }
 
     int main()
     {
         std::weak_ptr&lt;int> weak;
         std::cout &lt;&lt; "weak_ptr&lt;> not yet initialized\n";
         observe(weak);
 
         {
             auto shared = std::make_shared&lt;int>(42);
             weak = shared;
             std::cout &lt;&lt; "weak_ptr&lt;> initialized with shared_ptr.\n";
             observe(weak);
         }
 
         std::cout &lt;&lt; "shared_ptr&lt;> has been destructed due to scope exit.\n";
         observe(weak);
     }
     --------------------------------------- 
     Output:
     weak_ptr&lt;> not yet initialized
        observe() unable to lock weak_ptr&lt;>
     weak_ptr&lt;> initialized with shared_ptr.
        observe() able to lock weak_ptr&lt;>, value=42
     shared_ptr&lt;> has been destructed due to scope exit.
        observe() unable to lock weak_ptr&lt;>

  <Question>
      What is vector?
  </Question>
  <Answer>
    A vector is a dynamic array that can only grow in one direction, and is contiguously allocated 
    in memory.

   vector pros and cons:
   - fast insert/remove at the end: O(1)
   - slow insert/remove at the begining and middle: O(n)
   - slow search (linear time): O(n)
   - random access
  </Answer>
</QA>

<QA ID="8" type="OneAnswer" category="CPP" countdown="0" resetto="0" >
  <Question>
      What is deque ?
  </Question>
  <Answer>
      A deque is a dynamic array that can grow in both directions, it is an indexed sequence container 
      that allows fast insertion and deletion at both its beginning and its end. In addition, insertion 
      and deletion at either end of a deque never invalidates pointers or references to the rest of 
      the elements. As opposed to std::vector, the elements of a deque are not stored contiguously: 
      typical implementations use a sequence of individually allocated fixed-size arrays, with additional 
      bookkeeping, which means indexed access to deque must perform two pointer dereferences, compared 
      to vector's indexed access which performs only one.

      The storage of a deque is automatically expanded and contracted as needed. Expansion of a deque is 
      cheaper than a std::vector because it does not involve copying of the existing elements to a new 
      memory location. On the other hand, deques typically have large minimal memory cost; a deque 
      holding just one element has to allocate its full internal array (e.g. 8 times the object size on 
      64-bit libstdc++; 16 times the object size or 4096 bytes, whichever is larger, on 64-bit libc++).

      The complexity (efficiency) of common operations on deques is as follows:

      1. Fast Random access - constant O(1)
      2. Fast Insertion or removal of elements at the end or beginning - constant O(1)
      3. Slow Insertion or removal of elements - linear O(n)

  <Question>
      What is array and what is its pros and cons ?
  </Question>
  <Answer>
      An array is a collection of elements of the same type placed in contiguous memory locations 
    that can be individually referenced by using an index to a unique identifier.
      Array is fixed in size! and different size makes them different types.

  <Question>
      What is RAII ??
  </Question>
  <Answer>
      It is Resource Acquisition is initialization.
         In RAII, holding a resource is tied to object lifetime: resource allocation
      (or acquisition) is done during object creation by the constructor, 
      while resource deallocation (release) is done during object destruction
      by the destructor.

      What are STL Containers
  </Question>
  <Answer>
   STL Containers can be divieded into 3 categories:
   1) Sequence Containers (Array and linked list)
       - vector
       - deque
       - list
       - forward list
       - array
   2) Associative Containers (binary tree)
       - set, multiset,
       - map, multimap
   3) Unordered Containers (hash table)
       - Unordered set/multiset;
       - Unordered map/multimap

   its headers to include: 
        - &lt;vector&gt;
        - &lt;deque&gt;
        - &lt;list&gt;
        - &lt;set&gt;
        - &lt;map&gt;
        - &lt;unordered_set&gt;
        - &lt;unordered_map&gt;

   other STL includes:
        - &lt;iterator&gt;
        - &lt;algorithm&gt;
        - &lt;numeric&gt;     
        - &lt;functional&gt;  //for functors

   methods shared across all containers:
   - empty()   //check for empty
   - size()
   - clear()   //remove all elements
   - swap(T)   //swap all elements

  <Question>
      What is associate containers ?
  </Question>
  <Answer>
      Associate containers refer to map/multimap and set/multiset.
      Associate means keys are associated with values
      For set/multiset, the keys can be considered the same as values
      - They are always sorted, so no push_front(), push_back() methods
      - They are implemented as binary tree.
      - They are fast in search
      - They are slow in traversing
      - No Random acces, no [] operator
      - Elements (keys) can't be modified

      What about unordered containers ? what are unordered containers and what are their pros and cons
  </Question>
  <Answer>
      Unordered set/multiset, map/multimap are unordered containers
      they are implemented as hash tables 
      has following features:
        -fast search O(1)
        -fast insert O(1)
        -element value can't be changed for unordered set/multiset
        -element key can't be change for unordered map/multimap

  <Question>
      What is Associate Array?
  </Question>
  <Answer>
      Associate Array is map and unordered map. They are Associate Containers with [] operators.
      
      Following snippet shows its usages:
       
      unordered_map&lt;char, string&gt; day={{'S',"Sunday"},{'M',"Monday"}};

      cout &lt;&lt; day['S']    &lt;&lt; endl;    //No  range check
      cout &lt;&lt; day.at('S') &lt;&lt; endl;    //Has range check

      vector&lt;int&gt; vec={1,2,3};
      vec[5]=5;                             // compile Error: out of range

      day['W'] = "Wednesday";               //OK, inserting {'W',"Wednesday'}
      day.insert(make_pair('F',"FRIDAY"));  //inserting, same as above

      day.insert(make_pair('M',"MONDAY));   //Already exist for M, failed
      day['M'] = "MONDAY";                  //Succeeded modifying: [] operator has write access

      //Effect of [] operator's write access:
      void foo (const unordered_map&lt;char, string&gt; &#38; m ) { //param m is const reference
         m['S'] = "SUNDAY";                  //compile error, write access
         cout &lt;&lt; m['S'] &lt;&lt; endl;            //compile error too for print access, which is write access writing this way
         auto itr = m.find('S');
         if(itr !=m.end())
           cout &lt;&lt; itr-&gt;second &lt;&lt;endl;       //compile OK, no write access !
      }

      foo(day);

      //so, use map or unordered map ? here are the factors to consider:
      // Associate array: map and unordered_map only:
      1 search O(1): unordered_map =&gt; may degrade to O(n)
          O(log(n)): map =&gt; garanteed O(log(n)) search time
      2 Can't use multimap and unordered_multimap:
          they do not have [] operator, so can't be used as an array

      What is Container Adapter ?
  </Question>
  <Answer>
      Container Adapter provide restricted interface to underlying containers to meet special needs
      they are implemetned with fundamental container classes. There are 3:
      1. queue: FIFO:   push(), pop(), front(), back()
      2. stack: LIFO:   push(), Pop(), top()
      3. priority queue:push(), pop(), top(). First item always has the greatest priority

  <Answer>
      1: Ramdom access iterators: vector, deque, array
      2: Bidirectional Iterators: list, set/multiset, map/multimap
      3: Forward Iterators: forward_list
      4: Input Iterator: int x = *itr; //can only move forward
      5: Output Iterator: *itr=100;    //can only move forward 

      Every container has a iterator and a const_iterator (Snippet):
      set&lt;int&gt;::iterator itr;           //RW access to container elements
      set&lt;int&gt;::const_interator citr;   //readonly access to container elements

  <Question>
    What is Iterator Adapter ?
  </Question>
  <Answer>
    Iterator adapters are predefined iterators, they are more powerful:

      1. Insert iterator (back_insert_iterator,front_insert_iterator)
      2. Stream iterator
      3. Reverse iterator
      4. Move iterator (c++11)

    Snippet:
      1. Insert iterator:

      vector&lt;int&gt; vec1 = {4,5};
      vector&lt;int&gt; vec2 = {13,14,16,18};
      vector&lt;int&gt;::iterator it = find(vec2.begin(),vec2.end(),16);
      insert_iterator&lt;vector&lt;int&gt;&gt; i_itr(vec2,it);
      copy(vec1.begin(),vec1.end(),i_itr);   //vec2: {12,14,4,5,16,18}
      // Other insert iterators: back-insert_iterator, front_insert_iterator

      2. Stream iterator: iterat through the data to and from a string:
         vector&lt;string&gt; vec4;
         copy(istream_iterator&lt;string&gt;(cin), istream_iterator&lt;string&gt;(),     //copy source range
             back_inserter(vec4));                                           //copy dest, insert everything into vec4 from input stream
         copy(vec4.begin(),vec4.end(),ostream_iterator&lt;string&gt;(cout, " "));  //dump vec4 to cout with " " as delimiter       
         //merge the 2 copy operation above into one:
         copy(istream_iterator&lt;string&gt;(cin),istream_iterator&lt;string&gt;(),
              ostream_iterator&lt;string&gt;(cout," "));  
            
      3. Reverse iterator: travese container in reversed order
         vector&lt;int&gt; vec = {4,5,6,7};
         reversee_iterator&lt;vector&lt;int&gt;::iterator&gt; ritr;
         for(ritr = vec.rbegin(); ritr!=vec.rend();ritr++)
             cout &lt;&lt; *ritr &lt;&lt; endl;     //prints: 7,6,5,4

  <Question>
      Why is pre increment (++i) faster than post increment (i++) ?
  </Question>
  <Answer>
      pre increment is faster because post-increment i++ needs to keep old value before increasing its own value,
      so it needs to create a temporary variable to hold the old value.

      what is the difference between new and malloc() in terms of memory allocation ?
  </Question>
  <Answer>
      In C++, if the runtime system cannot allocate sizeof(Fred) bytes of memory during p= new Fred(), 
      a std::bad_alloc exception will be thrown.

      What are C++ storage classes?
  </Question>
  <Answer>
      There are 4 storage classes: 
                       Lifetime:
        1. auto        Function Block       
        2. register    Function Block       
        3. static      Whole Program
        3. extern      Whole Program

         auto: the default. Variables are automatically created and initialized when they 
               are defined and are destroyed at the end of the block containing their 
               definition. They are not visible outside that block.
         (another auto for data type / class) auto i = 1; //i is auto declared as integer, c++11 ?)
         register: a type of auto variable. a suggestion to the compiler to use a 
               CPU register for performance.
         static: a variable that is known only in the function that contains its 
               definition but is never destroyed and retains its value between calls 
               to that function. It exists from the time the program begins execution.
         extern: a static variable whose definition and placement is not determined until
               all object and library modules are combined (linked) to form the executable 
               code file. It can be visible outside the file where it is defined.

  <Question>
      What is keyword volatile and how to use it ?
  </Question>
  <Answer>
        C's volatile keyword is a qualifier that is applied to a variable when it is declared. 
      It tells the compiler that the value of the variable may change at any time--without 
      any action being taken by the code the compiler finds nearby. 

      volatile is used to prevent changes from compiler optimization; 

      2 ways to declare it:

      volatile uint16_t x; 
      uint16_t volatile y;

      if you really must have a volatile pointer to a volatile variable, you'd write:

      uint16_t volatile * volatile p_y;

      It is used for things like memory-mapped I/O registers

      Proper Use of C's volatile Keyword:

        A variable should be declared volatile whenever its value could change unexpectedly. 
      In practice, only three types of variables could change:

      1. Memory-mapped peripheral registers
      2. Global variables modified by an interrupt service routine
      3. Global variables accessed by multiple tasks within a multi-threaded application

          Embedded systems contain real hardware, usually with sophisticated peripherals. 
      These peripherals contain registers whose values may change asynchronously to the 
      program flow. As a very simple example, consider an 8-bit status register that is 
      memory mapped at address 0x1234. It is required that you poll the status register 
      until it becomes non-zero. The naive and incorrect implementation is as follows:

      uint8_t * p_reg = (uint8_t *) 0x1234;

      // Wait for register to read non-zero 
      do { ... } while (0 == *p_reg)

      This code will almost certainly fail as soon as you turn compiler optimization on.

      what is the difference between stack and heap ?
  </Question>
  <Answer>
     Stack is used for static memory allocation and Heap for dynamic memory allocation.  
       
     Use stack if you know the size before compile time.
     Use heap if you do not know the size until runtime.

     In a multi-threaded situation each thread will have its own completely independent 
     stack but they will share the heap. Stack is thread specific and Heap is application 
     specific. The stack is important to consider in exception handling and thread executions.

  <Answer>
     Function overloading is a programming concept that allows programmers to define 
     two or more functions with the same name and in the same scope. Each function has 
     a unique signature, which is derived from:

      1: function name
      2: number of arguments
      3: arguments' type
      4: arguments' order

      return type is not included in making function signature

  <Question>
     how can we pass an object into a thread by reference so that we can get the return value from it?
  </Question>
  <Answer>
     by using std::ref(obj);
 
     Snippet:
     class Fnctor{
     public:
        void operator()(string &amp; msg){
           cout &lt;&lt; "t1 says: "&lt;&lt; msg &lt;&lt; endl;
           msg="Trues is the mother of deceit";        //pass back a diff msg to show it is by ref
        }
     };
     void main(){
       string s="main org msg";     //notice how to pass a param to thread the line below, use 2nd parm to thread
       std::thread t1((fnctor()), std:ref(s));  //extra pair of () is needed here to make t1 not a def of fn
       t1.join();                   //if not use ref() here, it will auto use pass by value even though callee is &#38;msg 
       cout &lt;&lt; "From main: " &lt;&lt; s &lt;&lt; endl;
     }

     However, this could cause the 2 threads (parent and child) both have access to the same object, 
     so, access to it needs to be synchronized between the 2 threads.
     If this situation is required, we recommend using std::async() instead of spawn a thread!

     * To pass an object to thread by value is costly, by reference is not safe. 
      using move is both safe and efficient:
      std::thread t1((Fnctor()),std::move(s));

      * thread can not be copied, only be moved:
      std::thread t2 = std::move(t1);
      t2.join();

      * to get thread ID using:
       std::thread_thread::get_id()
       or
       t2.get_id();

        t1.join() // main thread waits for t1 to finish here               
     }

     After a thread is spawn, it can join in or detach from 
     main thread once.
     
     To tell if a thread is joinable, do test first:

     if(t1.joinable())
        ti.join();

     //if not joinable, it will crash if you call join()
     //the thread can also detach from main thread:

      t1.detach(); //t1 will run freely, a daemon process, 
     // c++ runtime library will reclaim the resources when t1 finishes

     //if t1 is finished before it is detached or joined the main thread
     //the process will end!, so it has to be joined or detached before it finishes!

     Why the direct use of mutex is not recommended ? 
     What is recommended for using mutex ?
  </Question>
  <Answer>
     When mutex is used directly, if an exceptions happens while a thread is accessing the protected 
     resources while mutex is locked, then there would be no way to unlock the mutex and all the other 
     threads will be blocked from accessing forever.

     std::lock_guard class template is recommended to use with mutex. so, just use following line
     std::lock_guard&lt;std::mutex&gt; guard(mu);
     in the place of mu.lock() and remove the mu.unlock().
     when exception happens, guard will be destroyed and its destructor will auto unlock the mutex (RAII)

     What is data race, how to avoid it ?
  </Question>
  <Answer>
     A data race occurs when 2 instructions from different threads in a single process access the same memory 
     location concurrently, and at least one of these accesses is a write and there is no synchronization 
     that is mandating any particular order among these accesses.

     To avoid data race:
      1. Use mutex to synchronize the data access
      2. Never leak a handle of data to outside
      3. Design interface appropriately

     What is the difference between pointer and reference ?
  </Question>
  <Answer>
     A difference between pointers and references is that a pointer is an indepedent variable and can be 
     assigned NEW address values; whereas a reference, once assigned, can never refer to any new object 
     until the variable goes out of scope.

     snippet example:

       string s1("Nancy");
       string s2("Clancy");

       string &amp;rs = s1;  // rs refers to s1
       string *ps = &amp;s1; // ps points to s1

       Note: this looks like you can change what a reference refers, it actuallly changes refered variable value:
       rs = s2;          // rs still refers to s1,   
                         // but s1's value is now "Clancy"

       ps = &amp;s2;         // ps now points to s2; s1 is unchanged

       =========================================================
       The example shows the difference:
 
       reference assignment:  rs=s1;   //changes the value of variable it referes
       pointer assignment:    ps=&amp;s1;  //changes the address value the ps holds, make it points to a new 
                                       //variable holding the assigned value

       So, we can say that a reference to a variable is just an alias for the variable!

  </Question>
  <Answer>
    C++ introducing 4 new cast operators:
     
    1: static_cast: for c cast except casting away the const
    2: const_cast: cast away the const-ness
    3: dynamic_cast: safe cast down or across an inheritance hierarchy casting from base into derived class objects.
                       return null if failed. no cast away const-ness
    4: reinterpret_cast: perform type conversions whose result is always implementation-defined. Used for casting function pointer types

    Snippet example:

    double result=(double)A/B;
    should become:
    double result=static_cast&lt;double&gt;A/B;

  <Question>
     Why should we always provide default constructors when we design a class ?
  </Question>
  <Answer>
     Default constructor is a one without argument!
     If a class lacks a default constructor, its use may be problematic in three contexts:

     1: Creation of arrays: when creating an array of objects, default constructor is always called.

     2: They are ineligible for use with many template-based container classes. Classes without default constructors 
        will be incompatible with many templates.

     3: Virtual base classes lacking default constructors are a pain to work with. That's because the arguments for 
        virtual base class constructors must be provided by the most derived class of the object being constructed. 
        As a result, a virtual base class lacking a default constructor requires that all classes derived from that 
        class - no matter how far removed - must know about, understand the meaning of, and provide for the virtual 
        base class&apos;s constructors&apos; arguments. Authors of derived classes neither expect nor appreciate 
        this requirement.

  <Question>
     Why cannot the operator &lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt; be overloaded as member functions ?
  </Question>
  <Answer>
     When overloaded as a member function, a &lt;&lt; b is interpreted as a.operator&lt;&lt;(b), so it only takes 
     one explicit parameter (with this as a hidden parameter).

     Since this requires that the overload be part of the class used as the left-hand operand a (in a &lt;&lt; b), 
     it's not useful with normal ostreams and such. It would require that your overload be part of the ostream 
     class, not part of your class. Since you're not allowed to modify ostream, you can't do that. That leaves 
     only the global overload as an alternative.

     if you try to make it as a member function, it (operator &lt;&lt;) can only take one argument, with second being 
     self *this.

  <Question>
     Why do you still need definition block when you declare a pure virtual destructor ?
  </Question>
  <Answer>
     You need this definition, because the way virtual destructors work is that the most derived 
     class&apos;s destructor is called first, then the destructor of each base class is called. 
     That means that compilers will generate a call to base class destructor even though the class
     is abstract, so you have to be sure to provide a body for the function. If you don't, the 
     linker will complain about a missing symbol.

     Explain how 2 processes communicate using message queue in unix.
  </Question>
  <Answer>
     Two (or more) processes can exchange information via access to a common system message queue. 
     The sending process places a message onto a queue which can be read by another process. Each 
     message is given an identification or type so that processes can select the appropriate message. 
     Process must share a common key in order to gain access to the queue in the first place.

     IPC messaging lets processes send and receive messages, and queue messages for processing in 
     an arbitrary order. Each IPC message has an explicit length. Messages can be assigned a specific 
     type. Because of this, a server process can direct message traffic between clients on its queue
     by using the client process PID as the message type. For single-message transactions, multiple 
     server processes can work in parallel on transactions sent to a shared message queue.

     Before a process can send or receive a message, the queue must be initialized (through the msgget 
     function) Operations to send and receive messages are performed by the msgsnd() and msgrcv() 
     functions, respectively.

     What is inode number ?
  </Question>
  <Answer>
     An inode is an entry in inode table, containing information ( the metadata ) 
     about a regular file and directory

     Inode number also called index number, it consists following attributes.

     1: File types ( executable, block special etc )
     2: Permissions ( read, write etc )
     3: UID ( Owner )
     4: GID ( Group )
     5: FileSize
     6: Time stamps, including last access, last modification and last inode number change.
     7: File deletion time
     8: Number of links ( soft/hard )
     9: Location of File on harddisk.
     10:Some other metadata about file.

     to check inode number of file, use following command. The first field is inode number:

     $ls -il readme.txt
      1150561 -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 Mar 10 01:06 tecadmin.txt

     you can search for a file by inode number using find:

     $find -inum 1150561 
     ./readme.txt

     move and rename does not change the inode number (within one file system),  they only change
     the time stamps in inode table (a table for a directory for all its files, subdirs,parent dirs)

     what is hardlink ?
  </Question>
  <Answer>
     A hard link is just an additional name for an existing file 
     Hard links can also be created to other hard links. Any number 
     of hard links, and thus any number of names, can be created for 
     any file. Hard links can also be created to other hard links. 
     However, they cannot be created for directories, and they cannot 
     cross filesystem boundaries or span across partitions

     Perhaps the most useful application for hard links is to allow 
     files, programs and scripts to be easily accessed in a different 
     directory from the original file or executable file. Typing the 
     name of the hard link will cause the program or script to be 
     executed in the same way as using its original name.
   
     use the command ln to create a hard link:
     $ln file1 hlink1 

     Example:

     $ ln aaa opennote
     $ ls -l
                 number of hlinks

     what is softlink ?
  </Question>
  <Answer>
     A symbolic link, also termed a soft link, is a special kind 
     of file that points to another file, much like a shortcut in 
     WINDOWS or a Macintosh alias. Unlike a hard link, a symbolic 
     link does not contain the data in the target file. It simply 
     points to another file(entry) somewhere in the file system.
     And it can cross filesystem boundaries

     file, much like a shortcut. Unlike a hard link, a symbolic 
     link does not contain the data in the target file. It simply

     To create a soft link:
     ln -s file linkname
     
     example:

     $ ln -s aaa opennoteSoft
     $ ls -il aaa open*
                       l in this column shows it is a softlink

  <Question>
     What is difference between hardlink and soft link ?
  </Question>
  <Answer>
     This difference gives symbolic links certain qualities that 
     hard links do not have, such as the ability to link to directories, 
     or to files on remote computers networked through NFS. Also, when 
     you delete a target file, symbolic links to that file become unusable, 
     whereas hard links preserve the contents of the file.

	  catch (int a) {
		cout &lt;&lt; a;

  </Question>
  <Answer>
     It wont print anything. The program will crash and throw an exception!
     Because the destructor is throwing an exception 42 before the previous 
     exception 32 is handled.

     Yes, destructors are guaranteed to be called on stack unwinding, including 
     unwinding due to exception being thrown. ... Destructor of the class is 
     not called if exception is thrown in its constructor. Exception is 
     automatically re-thrown if caught in construction initialization list 
     catch block.

     Never throw exception from destructors !

  <Question>
     Boost Library ?
  </Question>
  <Answer>
     Boost is a set of libraries for the C++ programming language that provide support for tasks 
and structures such as linear algebra, pseudorandom number generation, multithreading, image processing, 
regular expressions, and unit testing. It contains over eighty individual libraries.

Most of the Boost libraries are licensed under the Boost Software License, designed to allow Boost to 
be used with both free and proprietary software projects. Many of Boost's founders are on the C++ standards 
committee, and several Boost libraries have been accepted for incorporation into both the C++ Technical 
Report 1 and the C++11 standard.

The libraries are aimed at a wide range of C++ users and application domains. They range from general-purpose 
libraries like the smart pointer library, to operating system abstractions like Boost FileSystem, to libraries 
primarily aimed at other library developers and advanced C++ users, like the template metaprogramming (MPL) 
and domain-specific language (DSL) creation (Proto).

In order to ensure efficiency and flexibility, Boost makes extensive use of templates. Boost has been a source 
of extensive work and research into generic programming and metaprogramming in C++.

Most Boost libraries are header based, consisting of inline functions and templates, and as such do not need 
to be built in advance of their use. Some Boost libraries coexist as independent libraries.

     Boost smart pointer ?
  </Question>
  <Answer>
    Smart pointers
     1.Scoped pointer: scoped_ptr

	#include &lt;boost/scoped_ptr.hpp&gt;

        struct Object{
           int value;
        }
        void main(){
	   boost::scoped_ptr&lt;int&gt; int_ptr(new int);   //delete itself when go out scope
           int_ptr.reset(new int);                    //
	
           boost::scoped_ptr&lt;Object&gt; ptr;
	   if(ptr) {
	    //do something here. but ptr is null now, so it won't come in here
	   }
	
	   ptr.reset(new Object);
	   if(ptr){
	     Object object=*ptr;
		ptr-&gt;value=5;
	   }
        }      
        //scope pointers 
        1)cannot copy
        2)cannot use STL containers 
        3)can swap with another scoped_ptr
        4)can reset

   2. shared pointer:

        #include &lt;boost/shared_ptr.hpp&gt;
        void main(){
           boost::shared_ptr&lt;int&gt; int_ptr(new int);
           Owner a(int_ptr);
           Owner b(int_ptr);
           Owner c(int_ptr);
           //no need to delete here anymore
           //you can copy it, can use with STL containers

     What is C++ Singleton design pattern?
  </Question>
  <Answer>
     C++ Singleton class design pattern and methodology ensures that only one instance 
     of the C++ class is instantiated. 
     It usually implements a static method called instance() that returns a pointer to 
     its instance if already created or create a new one.

     2 advantages:
     1: Ensure a class has only one instance, and provide a global point of access to it.
     2: Encapsulated "just-in-time initialization" or "initialization on first use". 

     Snippet:
       Logger* Logger::Instance(){
          if (!m_pInstance)   // Only allow one instance of class to be generated.
             m_pInstance = new Logger;

      //hide how the object is created, just pick a choice:
      Stooge *Stooge::make_stooge(int choice)
      {
        if (choice == 1)
          return new Larry;

  </Question>
  <Answer>
     The Open System Interconnection (OSI) model defines a networking framework to implement protocols 
     in seven layers. They are:

     Layer 7: Application Layer - supports application and end-user processes. Communication partners are identified.
     Layer 6: Presentation - This layer provides independence from differences in data representation by translating 
              from application to network format, and vice versa. 
     Layer 5: Session - This layer establishes, manages and terminates connections between applications
     Layer 4: Transport - provides transparent transfer of data between end systems, error recovery and flow control
     Layer 3: Network -provides switching and routing technologies, creating logical paths, known as virtual circuits
     Layer 2: Data Link - data packets are encoded and decoded into bits.
     Layer 1: Physical- conveys the bit stream - electrical impulse, light or radio signal - through 
              the network at the electrical and mechanical level

     RTOS is priority based. it uses pre-emptive task scheduling method and is light weight and small in size. The kernel 
     of an RTOS is preemptible where as a GPOS kernel is not preemptible.

     The primary features of the VxWorks OS include, but are not limited to, a multitasking kernel that includes pre-emptive 
     and round robin scheduling as well as fast interrupt response; memory protection, in order to isolate user applications 
     from the kernel; SMP support, an error handling framework; a file system; and local and distributed message queues.

     how does Java achieve polymorphism ?
  </Question>
  <Answer>
     Static Polymorphism: It is achieved through function overloading and operator overloading.
     Dynamic Polymorphism : It is also called as run-time polymorphism. In this case java compiler does not know which 
     method is invoked at compilation time. Just JVM decides which method is invoked at the run-time. Method overriding 
     is example of run-time polymorphism. In this case overridden method is invoking through the super class reference 
     variable.

     How to push to github ?
  </Question>
  <Answer>
     To push to github:
        0. create a new repository on github without README.md
        1. get github URL, for example: https://github.com/zhuyali2018/Test.git
        2. add URL using command: git remote add origin &lt;URL&gt;
           example: git remote add origin https://github.com/zhuyali2018/Test.git
        3. verify the new remote URL setting: git remote -v
        4. push using command: git push origin &lt;branch name&gt;
           example: git push origin master
                    git push origin new-branch-name
           Note, this last step needs to do in cmd.exe instread of cygwin: 
           NOTE: Actually just use git push, it defaults to current branch with origin
           NOTE2: actully, before you can push to github, you have to pull first or do
                 a git clone, like:

                     git clone https://github.magicleap.com/yzhu/bugreportprocessor.git

                 it will create a directory named bugreportprocessor under current dir
                 you have to move all the files to the folder and commit those files 
                 before you can push those files to github:
                     git push origin master
           NOTE3: if you do not clone first, then, create a new repository without README.md

     About Anonymous Unions and Structures ?
  </Question>
  <Answer>
     Anonymous Unions and Structures are NOT part of C++ 11 standard, but most of the C++ 
     compilers support them. Since this is a C only feature, the C++ implementations don't 
     allow to anonymous struct/union to have private or protected members, static members, 
     and functions.

     Their definition looks like this:
        union 
        {
           char alpha;
           int num;
        };

        struct 
        {
           char alpha;
           int num;
        };

      They seem to have to be inside a named structure, like this:
      snippet:
      // C Program to demonstrate working of anonymous struct
      #include&lt;stdio.h&gt;
      struct Scope
      {
          // Anonymous structure
          struct
          {
              char alpha;
              int num;
          };
      };
 
      int main()
      {
          struct Scope x;
          x.num = 65;
          x.alpha = 'B';
 
          // Note that members of structure are accessed directly
          printf("x.alpha = %c, x.num = %d", x.alpha, x.num);
 
          return 0;
      }

     What happens when an exeption is thrown ?
  </Question>
  <Answer>
     When an exception is thrown, the control passes from a try block to a handler, 
     the C++ run time calls destructors for all automatic objects constructed since 
     the beginning of the try block. This process is called stack unwinding. 
     The automatic objects are destroyed in reverse order of their construction.

	b = new aaa;
	memset(b, 0, sizeof(b));
     }
  </Question>
  <Answer>
     sizeof(b) is wrong. It is meant to reset memory block pointed by b
     for the size of the block and sizeof(b) does not mean the size of the block
     it returns size of the pointer, which is usually 4. Should use sizeof(aaa);

     Can inline function be recursive ?
  </Question>
  <Answer>
    The compiler creates a call graph; when a cycle is detected calling 
    itself, the function is no longer inlined after a certain depth 
    (n=1, 10, 100, whatever the compiler is tuned to). Some recursive 
    functions can be transformed into loops, which effectively 
    infinitely inlines them.

     how to keep a process running after you have logged out?
  </Question>
  <Answer>
    nohup command-with-options &amp;

    When using the command shell, prefixing a command with nohup prevents 
    the command from being aborted automatically when you log out or exit 
    the shell.

    nohup mycommand

    Run the command mycommand. It will not receive input. All output, 
    including any error messages, will be written to the file nohup.out 
    in the working directory, or in your home directory. If mycommand is 
    running when you log out or close the terminal, mycommand will not 
    terminate.

    nohup mycommand &amp;

    Same as the previous command, but this form (when using the bash shell) 
    returns immediately to the shell prompt. The "&amp;" symbol at the end of 
    the command instructs bash to run nohup mycommand in the background. 
    It can be brought back to the foreground with the fg bash builtin command.

    When using &amp;, you'll see the bash job ID in brackets, and the process 
    ID (PID) listed after. For example:

    [1] 25132
 
    You can use the PID to terminate the process prematurely. For instance, 
    to send it the TERM (terminate) signal with the kill command:

    kill -9 25132

     A lambda expression has the form:

     The [] construct inside a function call's argument list indicates the beginning
     of a lambda expression. Please give a lambda example.

  </Question>
  <Answer>
     #include &lt;iostream>
     #include &lt;algorithm> 
     void main()
     {
        char s[]="Hello World!";
        int Uppercase = 0; //modified by the lambda

        });
        cout&lt;&lt; Uppercase&lt;&lt;" uppercase letters in: "&lt;&lt; s&lt;&lt;endl;
     }

     It's as if you defined a function whose body is placed inside another function call.
     The ampersand in [&amp;Uppercase] means that the lambda body gets a reference to
     Uppercase so it can modify it. Without the ampersand, Uppercase would be passed
     by value. C++11 lambdas include constructs for member functions as well.

     C+11 has changed the keyword "auto" to a new meaning, what is the new meaning ?
  </Question>
  <Answer>
     The keyword auto isn't new; it actually dates back the pre-ANSI C era. However,
     C++11 has changed its meaning; auto no longer designates an object with automatic 
     storage type. Rather, it declares an object whose type is deducible from its 
     initializer. The old meaning of auto was removed from C++11 to avoid confusion.

     The =default; part instructs the compiler to generate the default implementation 
     for the function

     The opposite of a defaulted function is a deleted function:

     How does c++11's nullptr fixed the NULL problem ?
  </Question>
  <Answer>
     nullptr replaces the bug-prone NULL macro and the literal 0 that have been used
     as null pointer substitutes for many years. nullptr is strongly-typed:

     void f(int);     //#1
     void f(char *);  //#2

     //C++03

     f(0);           //which f is called?

     //C++11

     f(nullptr)      //unambiguous, calls #2

     nullptr is applicable to all pointer categories, including function pointers and
      pointers to members:

     const char *pc=str.c_str(); //data pointers
     if (pc!=nullptr)
       cout&lt;&lt;pc&lt;&lt;endl;

     int (A::*pmf)()=nullptr; //pointer to member function

  <Question>
    In order to make a function defined in a C file callable from C++, you need to
     A. declare the function in an extern "C" block.
     B. ensure the function isn't overloaded.
     C. declare the function as static.
     D. Both A and B.

  </Question>
  <Answer>
     D
     The extern "C" line tells the compiler that the external information sent to the
      linker should use C calling conventions and name mangling (e.g., preceded by a
     single underscore). Since name overloading isn't supported by C, you can't make
     several overloaded functions simultaneously callable by a C program.

     The extern "C" block looks like this:

     extern "C" {

       #include "apache_gsoap.h"

     }

  <Question>
     What is dmesg ?
  </Question>
  <Answer>
     dmesg (Display message or driver message) is a command which will show 
     Kernel ring buffers. These messages contain valuable information about 
     device drivers loaded into the kernel at the time of booting as well as 
     when we connect a hardware to the system on the fly. In other words 
     dmesg will give us details about hardware drivers connected to, 
     disconnected from a machine and any errors when hardware driver is 
     loaded into the kernel. These messages are helpful in diagnosing or 
     debugging hardware and device driver issues. Already covered command 
     in the series is.
     Examples of dmesg usage:
     dmesg |less
     dmesg > boot_messages
     dmesg | grep -i usb
     dmesg | grep -i tty    //to show all serial ports
     dmesg | grep -i memory
     dmesg | grep -i dma    //to confirm that the HDD(s) is running in DMA 
                              (direct memory access) mode

     The output of dmesg is maintained in the log file /var/log/dmesg, and it 
     can thus also be easily viewed by reading that file with a text editor, 
     such as vi or gedit, or with a command such as cat, e.g.,

     cat /var/log/dmesg | less

     What is /proc directory in linux ?
  </Question>
  <Answer>
           Modern Linux distributions include a /proc directory as a virtual filesystem, 
     which stores and allows modification of the processes running in the system, 

     The proc filesystem (procfs) is a special filesystem in Unix-like operating systems that
     presents information about processes and other system information in a hierarchical
     file-like structure, providing a more convenient and standardized method for dynamically
     accessing process data held in the kernel than traditional tracing methods or direct
     access to kernel memory. Typically, it is mapped to a mount point named /proc at boot
     time. The proc file system acts as an interface to internal data structures in the
     kernel. It can be used to obtain information about the system and to change certain
     kernel parameters at runtime (sysctl).

     The Linux kernel extends it to non-process-related data.

     The proc filesystem provides a method of communication between kernel space and user
     space. For example, the GNU version of the process reporting utility ps uses the proc
     file system to obtain its data, without using any specialized system calls.

     Linux implementation includes a directory for each running process, including kernel
     processes, in directories named /proc/&lt;PID>, where PID is the process number. Each
     directory contains information about one process, including:

     /proc/&lt;PID>/cmdline, the command that originally started the process.
     /proc/&lt;PID>/cwd, a symlink to the current working directory of the process.

     What is strace ?
  </Question>
  <Answer>
    strace is a diagnostic, debugging and instructional userspace utility for Linux. 
    It is used to monitor and tamper with interactions between processes and the Linux 
    kernel, which include system calls, signal deliveries, and changes of process state. 
    The operation of strace is made possible by the kernel feature known as ptrace.

    Some Unix-like systems provide other diagnostic tools similar to strace, such as truss.

    Simple Example: Trace Linux Command (ls) System calls:

    $ strace ls
    execve("/bin/ls", ["ls"], [/* 19 vars */]) = 0
    brk(NULL)                               = 0x1f31000
    access("/etc/ld.so.nohwcap", F_OK)      = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
    access("/etc/ld.so.preload", R_OK)      = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
    open("/etc/ld.so.cache", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3
    fstat(3, {st_mode=S_IFREG|0644, st_size=25337, ...}) = 0
    ...
    getdents(3, /* 10 entries */, 32768)    = 320
    getdents(3, /* 0 entries */, 32768)     = 0
    close(3)                                = 0
    close(1)                                = 0
    close(2)                                = 0
    exit_group(0)                           = ?
    +++ exited with 0 +++
    $

    from above, you can see various types of system calls made by ls command, for example:
    
    open("/etc/ld.so.cache", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3

    Where:

       - open - is the type of system call
       - ("/etc/ld.so.cache", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) - system call argument
       - 3 - system call return value

  <Question>
     What is ptrace ?
  </Question>
  <Answer>
     ptrace is a system call found in Unix and several Unix-like operating systems. By using 
     ptrace (the name is an abbreviation of "process trace") one process can control another, 
     enabling the controller to inspect and manipulate the internal state of its target. 

     ptrace is used by debuggers and other code-analysis tools, mostly as aids to software 
     development.

     ptrace is used by debuggers (such as gdb and dbx), by tracing tools like strace and
     ltrace, and by code coverage tools. ptrace is also used by specialized programs to patch
     running programs, to avoid unfixed bugs or to overcome security features. It can further
     be used as a sandbox and as a run-time environment simulator (like emulating root
     access for non-root software).

     By attaching to another process using the ptrace call, a tool has extensive control over
     the operation of its target. This includes manipulation of its file descriptors, memory,
     and registers. It can single-step through the target's code, can observe and intercept
     system calls and their results, and can manipulate the target's signal handlers and both
     receive and send signals on its behalf. The ability to write into the target's memory
     allows not only its data store to be changed, but also the application's own code
     segment, allowing the controller to install breakpoints and patch the running code of the
     target.

     As the ability to inspect and alter another process is very powerful, ptrace can attach
     only to processes that the owner can send signals to (typically only their own
     processes); the superuser account can ptrace almost any process (except init on kernels
     before 2.6.26). In Linux systems that feature capabilities-based security, the ability to
     ptrace is further limited by the CAP_SYS_PTRACE capability[5] or by the YAMA Linux
     Security Module. In FreeBSD, it's limited by FreeBSD jails and Mandatory Access
     Control policies.

     What is SOAP?     
  </Question>
  <Answer>
    SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a messaging protocol specification for exchanging structured information 
    in the implementation of web services in computer networks. Its purpose is to induce extensibility, neutrality 
    and independence. It uses XML Information Set for its message format, and relies on application layer protocols, 
    most often Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) or Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), for message negotiation 
    and transmission.

    SOAP allows processes running on disparate operating systems (such as WINDOWS and Linux) to communicate using 
    Extensible Markup Language (XML). Since Web protocols like HTTP are installed and running on all operating systems, 
    SOAP allows clients to invoke web services and receive responses independent of language and platforms.

    - SOAP is a communication protocol designed to communicate via Internet.
    - SOAP can extend HTTP for XML messaging.
    - SOAP provides data transport for Web services.
    - SOAP can exchange complete documents or call a remote procedure.
    - SOAP can be used for broadcasting a message.
    - SOAP is platform- and language-independent.
    - SOAP is the XML way of defining what information is sent and how.
    - SOAP enables client applications to easily connect to remote services and invoke remote methods.

     Agile Methodology
  </Question>
  <Answer>
     The Agile Method is a particular approach to project management that is utilized in
     software development. This method assists teams in responding to the unpredictability of
     constructing software. It uses incremental, iterative work sequences that are commonly
     known as sprints.
     
     A sprint is a period of time allocated for a particular phase of a project. Sprints are
     considered to be complete when the time period expires. There may be disagreements among
     the members of the team as to whether or not the development is satisfactory; however,
     there will be no more work on that particular phase of the project. The remaining phases
     of the project will continue to develop within their respective time frames.
     
     The general principles of the Agile Method
     - Satisfy the client and continually develop software.
     - Changing requirements are embraced for the client's competitive advantage.
     - Concentrate on delivering working software frequently. Delivery preference will be
       placed on the shortest possible time span.
     - Developers and business people must work together throughout the entire project.
     - Projects must be based on people who are motivated. Give them the proper environment
       and the support that they need. They should be trusted to get their jobs done.
     - Face-to-face communication is the best way to transfer information to and from a team.
     - Working software is the primary measurement of progress.
     - Agile processes will promote development that is sustainable. Sponsors, developers, and
       users should be able to maintain an indefinite, constant pace.
     - Constant attention to technical excellence and good design will enhance agility.
     - Simplicity is considered to be the art of maximizing the work that is not done, and it
       is essential.
     - Self-organized teams usually create the best designs.
     - At regular intervals, the team will reflect on how to become more effective, and they
       will tune and adjust their behavior accordingly

     What the command git bisect can do ?
  </Question>
  <Answer>
     git bisect - Use binary search to find the commit that introduced a bug.

        This command uses a binary search algorithm to find which commit in your project's
     history introduced a bug. You use it by first telling it a "bad" commit that is known to
     contain the bug, and a "good" commit that is known to be before the bug was introduced.
     Then git bisect picks a commit between those two endpoints and asks you whether the
     selected commit is "good" or "bad". It continues narrowing down the range until it finds
     the exact commit that introduced the change.

     Example: 
     $ git bisect start
     $ git bisect bad                 # Current version is bad
     $ git bisect good v2.6.13-rc2

     What is NFS ?
  </Question>
  <Answer>
     NFS stands for Network File System, it is a distributed file system protocol originally 
     developed by Sun Microsystems in 1984, allowing a user on a client computer to access 
     files over a computer network much like local storage is accessed.

       The Network File System (NFS) is a client/server application that lets a computer user
     view and optionally store and update files on a remote computer as though they were on
     the user's own computer. The NFS protocol is one of several distributed file system
     standards for network-attached storage (NAS).
          
       NFS allows the user or system administrator to mount (designate as accessible) all or a
     portion of a file system on a server. The portion of the file system that is mounted can
     be accessed by clients with whatever privileges are assigned to each file (read-only or
     read-write). NFS uses Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) to route requests between clients and
     servers.

     What is printk ?
  </Question>
  <Answer>
     printk is a function that prints messages and is used in the C Programming Language
     exclusively for the Linux Kernel. It accepts a string parameter called the format string,
     which specifies a method for rendering an arbitrary number of varied data type
     parameter(s) into a string. The string is then printed to the kernel log.

     It provides a printf-like abstraction and its parsing of the format string and arguments
     behave exactly the same way. It acts as a debugging tool for kernel programmers who need
     this function for logging messages from the kernel.

     printk has an optional prefix string: Loglevel.

     Loglevel specifies the type of message being sent to the kernel message log. The syntax
     with loglevel is:
     printk(KERN_DEBUG "Debug message shown!\n");
     Different Loglevels, along with their numerical values, are shown here:

     0  KERN_EMERG      Emergency condition, system is probably dead
     1  KERN_ALERT      Some problem has occurred, immediate attention is needed
     2  KERN_CRIT       A critical condition
     3  KERN_ERR        An error has occurred
     4  KERN_WARNING    A warning   &lt;================ default level
     5  KERN_NOTICE     Normal message to take note of
     6  KERN_INFO       Some information
     7  KERN_DEBUG      Debug information related to the program
     When a log level is not specified, the default log level is KERN_WARNING, unless a
     different default has been set in the kernel itself.

     Loglevels are defined in &lt;linux/kern_levels.h>. Which log levels are printed is
     configured in the /proc/sys/kernel/printk sysctl file (format: console level, default
     message level, minimum console level, default console level)

  </Question>
  <Answer>
     (/dev) ls k* -al
     crw-r--r-- 1 root root 1, 11 Jul 10 00:12 kmsg

     kmsg here is a char device

     The /dev/kmsg character device node provides userspace access
     to the kernel's printk buffer.

     Every write() to the opened device node places a log entry in
     the kernel's printk buffer.
   
     Example: 
       mldb shell
       phaedra:/ # echo "test msg" > /dev/kmsg
       phaedra:/ # dmesg

     Why do I still get "permission denied" using sudo as following ? 
    
     sudo echo "Writing critical printk messages from userspace" > /dev/kmsg
  </Question>
  <Answer>
     sudo doesn't work because echo is not a command, it's a shell builtin. 
     The right way to do that is:

       echo "blah" | sudo tee /dev/kmsg

     tee is a command that copies stdin to a file and stdout. It's called tee 
     because it's like a T-shaped pipe in a pipeline.

     Example:

     $ (/home/zhuyali) echo "Yali test" > /dev/kmsg
     -bash: /dev/kmsg: Permission denied
     $ (/home/zhuyali) sudo echo "Yali test" > /dev/kmsg
     -bash: /dev/kmsg: Permission denied
     $ (/home/zhuyali)  echo "Yali test" | sudo tee /dev/kmsg

     Meta characters of grep are:
  </Question>
  <Answer>
     + - Equivalent to one or more occurrences of previous character.
     ? - This denotes atmost 1 repetition of previous character. Like: a? Would match 'a' or 'aa'.
     ( - Start of alternation expression.
     ) - End of alternation expression.
     | - Matching either of the expression separated by '|'. Like: "(a|b)cde" would match
         either 'abcde' or 'bbcde'.
     { - This meta-character indicates start of range specifier. Like: "a{2}" matches "aa" in
         file i.e. a 2 times.
     } - This meta-character indicates end of range specifier.

     Egrep Command

     Egrep or grep -E is another version of grep or the Extended grep. This version of grep is
     efficient and fast when it comes to searching for a regular expression pattern as it
     treats meta-characters as is and doesn't substitute them as strings like in grep, and
     hence you are freed from the burden of escaping them as in grep. It uses ERE or the
     Extended Regular Expression set.

  <Question>
     What is ipcs command ?
  </Question>
  <Answer>
     ipcs shows information on the inter-process communication facilities for which the 
     calling process has read access. 
     By default it shows information about all three resources: 
     1: shared memory segments, 
     2: message queues, 
     3: semaphore arrays. 

     Example:

     $ ipcs

     ------ Message Queues --------
     key        msqid      owner      perms      used-bytes   messages

     ------ Shared Memory Segments --------
     key        shmid      owner      perms      bytes      nattch     status
     0x00000000 0          root       644        80         2
     0x00000000 32769      root       644        16384      2
     0x00000000 65538      root       644        280        2

     ------ Semaphore Arrays --------
     key        semid      owner      perms      nsems
     0x000000a7 0          root       600        1

     the command ipcs -m only shows shared memory

     $ ipcs -m   (others are -q, -s)

     ------ Shared Memory Segments --------
     key        shmid      owner      perms      bytes      nattch     status
     0x00000000 0          root       644        80         2
     0x00000000 32769      root       644        16384      2
     0x00000000 65538      root       644        280        2

     void main(){
        char c[]={'a','b','c','d'};
        char d[]="abcd";
        printf("%d - %d",strlen(c),strlen(d));
     }

     A: 4 - 4
     B: 4 - 5
     C: * - 5 
     D: * - 4
  </Question>
  <Answer>
     D. strlen() will keep counting until it sees 0, which is NOT included!
     please notice the difference between strlen() and sizeof(), which counts ending 0
     Another difference is strlen takes (char *) and sizeof takes char array as an arg.

     What is an atomic operation ?
  </Question>
  <Answer>
     In concurrent programming, an operation (or set of operations) is atomic, linearizable,
     indivisible or uninterruptible if it appears to the rest of the system to occur at once
     without being interrupted. Atomicity is a guarantee of isolation from interrupts,
     signals, concurrent processes and threads.

     What is an atomic variable in C++?
  </Question>
  <Answer>
          Atomic types are types that encapsulate a value whose access is guaranteed to not cause
     data races and can be used to synchronize memory accesses among different threads. This
     header declares two C++ classes, atomic and atomic_flag , that implement all the features
     of atomic types in self-contained classes.

     Why should we always put double quots around a variable ?
  </Question>
  <Answer>
     Because if we don't and when the varaible is empty, it will be converted
     to something invalid, for example:
        if [ $1 != -v ]; then
     will be converted to:
        if [ != -v ]; then
     when empty, which is invalid. And with double quote:
        if [ "$1" != -v ]; then
     it will be converted to:
        if [ "" != -v ]; then
     when empty, which is still valid.

     How to commit changes in git ?
  </Question>
  <Answer>
         when you change a file which is already in the repository, 
     you have to git add it again if you want it to be staged.

         This allows you to commit only a subset of the changes you made 
     since the last commit. For example, let's say you have file a, file b 
     and file c. You modify file a and file b but the changes are very 
     different in nature and you don't want all of them to be in one single 
     commit. You issue

     git add a
     git commit a -m "bugfix, in a"
     git add b
     git commit b -m "new feature, in b"

     As a side note, if you want to commit everything you can just type

     git commit -a
     
     or 

     git commit -am "comment goes here"

     What is ninja in computing ?
  </Question>
  <Answer>
     Ninja is a small build system with a focus on speed. It differs from other build systems in 
     two major respects: it is designed to have its input files generated by a higher-level build 
     system, and it is designed to run builds as fast as possible.

     In essence, Ninja is meant to replace Make, which is slow when performing incremental (or no-op) 
     builds. This can considerably slow down developers working on large projects, such as Google 
     Chrome which compiles 30,000 input files into a single executable. In fact, Google Chrome is a 
     main user and motivation for Ninja. It's also used to build Android, and is used by most developers 
     working on LLVM.

     In contrast to Make, Ninja lacks features such as string manipulation, as Ninja build files are 
     not meant to be written by hand. Instead, a "build generator" should be used to generate Ninja 
     build files. CMake and Meson are popular build management software tools which support creating 
     build files for Ninja.

     What is ad-hoc build and what is base line build ?
  </Question>
  <Answer>
     Ad-hoc build is specially build one, can not rebuild locally from artifactory without 
     special directions from builder

     Baseline build can be fould in stable candidates SC, for example: 
     baseline A0C.180821.01-P.001 can be found at:
         https://artifactory.magicleap.com/artifactory/release/qdr/0.92.0/sc/A0C.180821.01-P.001/

     To rebuild baseline A0C.180821.01-P.001 locally, goto 
         https://artifactory.magicleap.com/artifactory/release/qdr/0.92.0/sc/A0C.180821.01-P.001/
       1. click full
       2. then, click release_notes-A0C.180821.01-P.001.html 
       3. copy the line under Commands to initialize Nova:

          repo init -u https://gerrit.magicleap.com/platform/mlmanifest -b sc-A0C.180821.01-P.001 
            --repo-url https://gerrit.magicleap.com/tools/repo --no-repo-verify 
            -g default,nova-browser,preload-apps,screens,platform-linux

       4. and exeute it under a dedicated empty folder
       5. copy and paste next line to the terminal and execute it: repo sync -c -q --no-tags
          this step will take a few hours maybe!
       6. run the command next for "Command to build Nova directly" to build the downloaded source locally:
          ./vendor/ml/proprietary/build/bin/build_device.sh -p phaedra_full -j 64 -v userdebug -o --archive-full-symbols --verbose

     What is regression test ?   
  </Question>
  <Answer>
     Regression testing is re-running functional and non-functional tests to ensure that previously developed and 
     tested software still performs after a change. If not, that would be called a regression. Changes that may 
     require regression testing include bug fixes, software enhancements, configuration changes, and even substitution 
     of electronic components. As regression test suites tend to grow with each found defect, test automation is 
     frequently involved. Sometimes a change impact analysis is performed to determine an appropriate subset of 
     tests.

  <Question>
     What is Futex ?
  </Question>
  <Answer>
     In computing, a futex (short for "fast userspace mutex") is a kernel system call 
   that programmers can use to implement basic locking, or as a building block for 
   higher-level locking abstractions such as semaphores and POSIX mutexes or condition 
   variables.

     A futex consists of a kernelspace wait queue that is attached to an atomic integer 
   in userspace. Multiple processes or threads operate on the integer entirely in 
   userspace (using atomic operations to avoid interfering with one another), and only 
   resort to relatively expensive system calls to request operations on the wait queue 
   (for example to wake up waiting processes, or to put the current process on the wait 
   queue). A properly programmed futex-based lock will not use system calls except when 
   the lock is contended; since most operations do not require arbitration between 
   processes, this will not happen in most cases.

     Futexes have two basic operations, WAIT and WAKE. A third operation called REQUEUE 
   is available and functions as a more generic WAKE operation that can move threads 
   between waiting queues.

     WAIT(addr, val)
   If the value stored at the address addr is val, puts the current thread to sleep.

     WAKE(addr, num)
   Wakes up num number of threads waiting on the address addr.

     CMP_REQUEUE(old_addr, new_addr, num_wake, num_move, val)
   If the value stored at the address old_addr is val, wakes num_wake threads waiting 
   on the address old_addr, and enqueues num_move threads waiting on the address old_addr 
   to now wait on the address new_addr. This can be used to avoid the Thundering herd 
   problem on wake.

     The Binder framework communication is a client server model. Each client 
     initiates communication and waits for response from the server. Each client 
     would have a proxy object for the client side communication. The server side 
     constitutes a pool of worker threads.The server shall spawn a new thread 
     for each new Binder request from the client. The bridge between the client 
     and the server process is the binder driver. The Binder driver is a character 
     device that is part of kernel space. This module  ensures the client reaches 
     the appropriate destination across process boundaries.

     What is the command dconf ?
  </Question>
  <Answer>
     dconf is a low-level configuration system. Its main purpose is to provide a 
     backend to GSettings on platforms that don't already have configuration storage 
     systems.

     dconf is a simple key-based configuration system. Keys exist in an unstructured 
     database (but it is intended that keys that logically belong together are 
     grouped together).

     Having all of the keys in a single compact binary format also avoids the intense 
     fragmentation problems currently experienced by the tree-of-directories-of-xml-files 
     approach.

     dconf is optimised for reads. Typically, reading a key from dconf involves zero 
     system calls and zero context switches. Writes are less optimised -- they traverse 
     the bus and are handled by a "writer" -- a DBus service -- in the ordinary way.

     There is also a gui version of the tool: dconf-editor

     What is thundering herd problem ?
  </Question>
  <Answer>
     In computer science, the thundering herd problem occurs when a large number of processes 
     waiting for an event are awoken when that event occurs, but only one process is able to 
     proceed at a time. After the processes wake up, they all demand the resource and a decision 
     must be made as to which process can continue. After the decision is made, the remaining 
     processes are put back to sleep, only to all wake up again to request access to the resource.

     This occurs repeatedly, until there are no more processes to be woken up. Because all the 
     processes use system resources upon waking, it is more efficient if only one process is woken 
     up at a time.

     This may render the computer unusable, but it can also be used as a technique if there is no 
     other way to decide which process should continue (for example when programming with semaphores).

     r means the string will be treated as raw string. From here: When an 'r' 
     or 'R' prefix is present, a character following a backslash is included 
     in the string without change, and all backslashes are left in the string. 
     For example, the string literal r"\n" consists of two characters: 
     a backslash and a lowercase 'n'.

     How to set tab to spaces in vi ?
  </Question>
  <Answer>
     1. Use expand tab to convert new tabs to spaces
         The expandtab property will ensure that when you hit tab it will actually use spaces. 
      So first set the number of spaces a tab should be, then set expandtab (in file ~/.vimrc ).

         set tabstop=2 shiftwidth=2 expandtab
 
      Tabstop determines how many columns a tab counts for. Shiftwidth determines how many 
      columns text is indented when using reindent operations. Expandtab is what actually uses spaces instead of tabs.
     2. Convert existing tabs to spaces
         If you've got a file already full of tabs, converting to spaces is super easy. Make sure 
      to follow step one first, then use retab.

      Open the file and type:

         :retab

      This will fix all existing tabs.
